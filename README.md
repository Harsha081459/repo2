## 📋 Project Description

This project implements an optimal trajectory generation system for an autonomous vehicle performing a lane change maneuver while avoiding a dynamic obstacle.

The vehicle is modeled using discrete-time double-integrator dynamics, and the problem is formulated as a Constrained Quadratic Program (QP). The goal is to minimize total control energy while satisfying safety constraints on motion and obstacle avoidance.

### Key Features

- **QP formulation** with linear equality and inequality constraints
- **Vehicle dynamics**:
  \[ 
  x_{k+1} = A x_k + B u_k 
  \]
- **Obstacle avoidance** using time-window constraints
- **KKT sensitivity analysis** (Lagrange multipliers / shadow prices)
- **Solver comparison** between OSQP and SCS
- **Interactive user inputs** for simulation parameters
